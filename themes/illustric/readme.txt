== Description ==

Illustric is a simple theme perfect for building simple portfolios or blogs with a strong visual accent. The theme is compatible with Full Site Editing (FSE) so all visible content is editable from the WordPress admin panel (from header, content to footer). Illustric uses a grayscale color palette to give all the importance to the works shown, being able to customize the color palette easily from the dashboard.

This theme is beta software, and is not meant for use on a production site.
