It reminds us of the Nordic landscapes; beautiful, calm, and relaxing. Created on a solidly designed foundation, the Scandinavia theme adopts the vision that everyone deserves a truly unique website. The Scandinavia theme is built to take advantage of the Full Site Editing features introduced in WordPress 5.9, so the colors, typography, and layout of every page on your site are configurable to suit your vision. It also includes block patterns, opening the door to a wide range of professionally designed layouts in just a few clicks. Whether youâ€™re building a single-page website, a blog, a business website, or a portfolio, Scandinavia will help you create a site that is uniquely yours."},"download_link":"https://downloads.wordpress.org/theme/scandinavia.1.1.0.zip","tags":{"block-patterns":"Block Editor Patterns","block-styles":"Block Editor Styles","blog":"Blog","custom-colors":"Custom Colors","custom-logo":"Custom Logo","custom-menu":"Custom Menu","editor-style":"Editor Style","featured-images":"Featured Images","full-site-editing":"Full Site Editing","one-column":"One Column","rtl-language-support":"RTL Language Support","sticky-post":"Sticky Post","threaded-comments":"Threaded Comments","translation-ready":"Translation Ready","wide-blocks":"Wide Blocks"}}
