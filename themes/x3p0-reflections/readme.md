A one-page user-profile WordPress theme.  Really, it's just a single page.

## Recommended

This theme is designed to work with WordPress 5.9+.  However, it also closely follows the development of the [Gutenberg plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg).  For the full power of the theme, users should install and activate the latest version.
