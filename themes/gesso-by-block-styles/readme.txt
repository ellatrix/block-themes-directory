A minimalistic block-first full site editing WordPress theme.

== Description ==
Gesso is a minimal block-first full-site editing theme ideal for those who want a blank canvas and complete creative control. Designed to leverage the block builder fully but can just as easily work with any other page builder.

The theme is built to take advantage of the latest Full Site Editing features introduced in WordPress 5.9. Everything from the colors, typography, and layout of every page on your site is ready to take on your vision without loads of clutter getting in the way.

=== Template, Template Parts, and Block Patterns ===

Gesso does not include any templates, template parts, or block patterns. 
This is on purpose, Gesso is meant to support users leveraging WordPress' Full Site Editing features including building templates, and template parts for any custom post types, taxonomies, etc. 

You can make anything, even a boat website.
