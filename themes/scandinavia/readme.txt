== Description ==

Scandinavian design is the inspiration for this WordPress theme: minimalist aesthetics, functional and muted, dark hues. It reminds us of the Nordic landscapes; beautiful, calm, and relaxing.

Created on a solidly designed foundation, the Scandinavia theme adopts the vision that everyone deserves a truly unique website. 

The Scandinavia theme is built to take advantage of the Full Site Editing features introduced in WordPress 5.9, so the colors, typography, and layout of every page on your site are configurable to suit your vision.

It also includes block patterns, opening the door to a wide range of professionally designed layouts in just a few clicks. Whether youâ€™re building a single-page website, a blog, a business website, or a portfolio, Scandinavia will help you create a site that is uniquely yours.


== Installation ==

2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.

== Setting Up ==

- Header navigation
  By default, the theme has two kinds of headers; the first can be found on the home page (Index) and the second is on the rest of the pages. You need to set the same navigation for both headers to make both have the same menu items.
