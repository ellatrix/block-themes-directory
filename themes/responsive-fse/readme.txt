Full-Site-Editing experimental theme.

== Description ==

Responsive FSE theme is an experimental theme for the next-generation Full Site Editing (FSE) currently available in Gutenberg.

Using this theme, you can easily change the complete layout of the post or page by editing templates. There are also useful blocks to play around with like Site Logo, Post Title, Post Author, Query, etc. 

The best part of the theme is that it is WooCommerce ready and you can add pre-defined block patterns to your pages and then further customize them according to your needs. The theme also allows users to add Template Parts like header, footer, sidebar, etc. to the template and also create new template parts.
