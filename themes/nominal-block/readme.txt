Full-Site-Editing experimental theme.

== Description ==
Nominal Block is an easy and responsive WordPress Full Site Editing Theme. It has developed with the concept of Single Page Application in mind and is compatible with all newly added features of WordPress 5.8. Moreover, you can edit or add new templates to your posts/pages. Your site appearance no longer looks like the elements generated by the theme. Unlikely classic themes, you donâ€™t have to manage global elements and page elements separately. This theme will help you out to build the entire website and manage Site Title, Post Title, Comments, and Post Content just by using Gutenberg editor.
